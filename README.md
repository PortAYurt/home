Port-A-Yurt exists to make yurt builds easy, simple and viable for DIY types.

# What is a Port-a-Yurt?

Modular: Built as flat panels in a factory or at home, erected on site in less than a day.

Permanent or Relocatable: Can be mounted permanently or dissembled in a day to
move elsewhere.

Transportable: Panels can be transported by anything from a car with a box trailer to a truck
with a hyab crane.

Multi-Sided, Small or Large: 6 â€“ 12 sided, 3.6 metres to 6.9 metres diameter. Can have
annexes and/or verandahs to expand the basic module.

Expandable: Any module can be easily added to later and joined with others of the same or
different size to make whole dwellings.
